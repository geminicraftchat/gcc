4. **Backup configuration**: `gcc backup`

### Performance Optimization
1. **Monitor memory usage**: `gcc memory`
2. **Adjust timeouts based on usage**: `gcc timeout list`
3. **Clear old statistics**: `gcc logs reset` (monthly)

### Player Support
1. **Check player issues**: `gcc player info <name>`
2. **Reset stuck conversations**: `gcc clear player <name>`
3. **Adjust personas for users**: `gcc persona set <name> <persona>`

### Model Management
1. **Switch models based on load**: `gcc model <name>`
2. **Adjust temperature for quality**: `gcc temp <value>`
3. **Enable long thinking for complex tasks**: `gcc timeout toggle <model>`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Commands not working from console?**
A: Ensure you're using the exact command syntax without the `/` prefix.

**Q: Cannot switch models?**
A: Check if the model is properly configured in config.yml and reload the plugin.

**Q: Timeout commands not available?**
A: Update to the latest version that includes the Long Thinking feature.

**Q: Statistics not showing?**
A: Enable logging in config.yml and restart the plugin.

### Debug Information

Enable debug mode to see detailed command execution:
```bash
gcc debug
```

This will show:
- Command processing details
- API call information
- Configuration loading status
- Error stack traces

## Security Notes

- **Console Access**: Only trusted administrators should have console access
- **API Keys**: Never display API keys in console output
- **Player Data**: Be careful when managing player-specific data
- **Backup**: Regular configuration backups are recommended
